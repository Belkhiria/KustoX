# 🔧 Query Limit Exceeded - Dual Window Solution

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

When a Kusto query exceeds the 64MB limit, you now get **BOTH**:
1. **Partial results** shown in the main results window
2. **Error details** shown in a separate error window

This matches **exactly** how Kusto Explorer works!

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **When Query Limit Is Exceeded:**

1. **Automatic Detection** 🔍
   - Detects errors containing:
     - `E_QUERY_RESULT_SET_TOO_LARGE`
     - `80DA0003`
     - `exceeded the allowed limits`
     - `64 MB`

2. **Dual Window Display** 📊📋
   - **Main Window**: Shows the partial results that were returned
   - **Second Window**: Shows detailed error information with solutions

3. **Smart Notifications** 📢
   - Warning message: "Query limit exceeded. Showing X partial results. Error details opened in second window."
   - Option to re-open error details if needed

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Large Query**
```kql
StormEvents 
| extend LargeText = strcat(EventNarrative, EventNarrative, EventNarrative, EventNarrative)
| take 10000
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Results window shows partial data that was returned
- ✅ Error window opens separately with limit exceeded message
- ✅ Notification explains the situation

### **Test Case 2: Very Large Query**
```kql
StormEvents 
| mv-expand split(EventNarrative, " ")
| take 50000
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Same dual-window behavior
- ✅ Clear error explanation with solutions

## 🎨 **Enhanced Error Display**

### **Query Limit Errors Get Special Treatment:**
- **⚠️ Warning icon** instead of ❌ error icon
- **Orange border** instead of red (matches VS Code warnings)
- **Solutions section** with helpful tips:
  - Add `| take 1000` to limit results
  - Use `| summarize` to aggregate data  
  - Add `where` filters to reduce data
  - Use `| project` to select fewer columns
- **Link to documentation** for more help

### **Regular Errors Stay The Same:**
- ❌ Red error styling for syntax errors, connection issues, etc.
- Standard error handling for all other error types

### **Before (Broken):**
- Query limit exceeded → Only error shown
- No partial results visible  
- User loses all data
- Confusing error messages

### **After (Fixed - Like Kusto Explorer):**
- Query limit exceeded → **Partial results + Error details**
- Main window shows available data
- Second window explains the issue
- Clear path to resolution
- Matches Kusto Explorer UX exactly

**Press F5** and try a large query that exceeds limits. You should see:

1. **Results window** with partial data

3. **Notification** explaining the situation
4. **Copy buttons** work on partial results
