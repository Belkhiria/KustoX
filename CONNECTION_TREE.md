# Connection Tree - Kusto Explorer-like Experience

## Overview

The KustoX Connection Tree provides a familiar interface similar to Kusto Explorer, allowing you to manage multiple Kusto clusters and databases directly from VS Code's Explorer panel.

## Features

### üå≥ Tree View Structure
- **Clusters**: Top-level items representing Kusto cluster connections
- **Databases**: Child items showing available databases in each cluster
- **Icons**: Visual indicators (server icon for clusters, database icon for databases)

### üîå Connection Management
- **Add Cluster**: Connect to new Kusto clusters with automatic database discovery
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically fetch and display all available databases
- **Remove Cluster**: Clean removal of cluster connections
- **Refresh**: Update the tree view with latest cluster information

### üîê Authentication
- **Azure Identity Integration**: Seamless authentication using Azure Device Code flow
- **Automatic Token Management**: Handles authentication tokens automatically
- **Multi-Cluster Support**: Connect to multiple clusters simultaneously

## Usage

### Adding a New Cluster

1. **Open the Connection Tree**
   - Look for "Kusto Clusters" in the VS Code Explorer panel
   - If not visible, ensure the KustoX extension is activated

2. **Add Cluster Button**
   - Click the "+" (Add Cluster) button in the tree view title
   - Or use Command Palette: `KustoX: Add Cluster`

3. **Enter Cluster URL**
   ```
   https://your-cluster.kusto.windows.net
   ```
   - The extension validates the URL format
   - Supports both full URLs and shorthand formats

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - The extension will initiate Azure Device Code authentication
   - Follow the prompts to sign in with your Azure credentials
   - Databases will be automatically discovered and displayed

### Connecting to a Database

1. **Expand Cluster**
   - Click the arrow next to a cluster to see its databases

2. **Click Database**
   - Click on any database name to connect
   - The extension will establish a connection for query execution

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Success message confirms the connection
   - The database becomes the active context for queries

### Managing Connections

#### Refresh Connections
- Click the refresh button (üîÑ) in the tree view title
- Updates the tree with current cluster information

#### Remove Cluster
- Right-click on a cluster ‚Üí "Remove Cluster"
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental removal

#### Copy Connection String
- Right-click on cluster or database ‚Üí "Copy Connection String"
- Copies the connection details to clipboard

## Tree View Commands

### Title Bar Commands
| Command | Icon | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Add Cluster | + | Add a new Kusto cluster connection |
| Refresh | üîÑ | Refresh the connection tree |

### Context Menu Commands
| Item Type | Command | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Cluster | Remove Cluster | Remove the cluster from the tree |
| Cluster | Copy Connection String | Copy cluster URL to clipboard |
| Database | Connect to Database | Set as active database for queries |
| Database | Copy Connection String | Copy cluster/database path to clipboard |

## Integration with Query Execution

### Automatic Context
- When you connect to a database via the tree, it becomes the default context
- All subsequent queries will execute against the selected database
- No need to manually configure connections in query files

### Seamless Workflow
1. Add cluster to tree
2. Click database to connect
3. Create/open .kql file
4. Execute queries with F5 or Run button

## Authentication Details

### Azure Device Code Flow
```typescript
// The extension uses Azure Device Code authentication
const kcsb = KustoConnectionStringBuilder.withAadDeviceAuthentication(clusterUrl);
const client = new KustoClient(kcsb);
```

### Benefits
- **No Client ID Required**: Uses Microsoft's public client registration
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Supports MFA and conditional access policies
- **Token Caching**: Automatically handles token refresh
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Storage and Persistence

### Connection Persistence
- Cluster connections are saved in VS Code's global state
- Persists across VS Code sessions and restarts
- No sensitive data stored locally (tokens handled by Azure SDK)

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface ConnectionItem {
    type: 'cluster' | database';
    name: string;
    cluster?: string;
    database?: string;
    children?: ConnectionItem[];
}
```

## Error Handling

### Connection Errors
- **Invalid URL**: Validation prevents malformed cluster URLs
- **Authentication Failure**: Clear error messages guide users to re-authenticate
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of connectivity problems
- **Permission Errors**: Informative messages about access rights

### User Feedback
- Success notifications for successful operations
- Warning dialogs for destructive actions (remove cluster)
- Error messages with actionable guidance

## Tips and Best Practices

### üéØ Cluster URL Formats
```
‚úÖ https://mycluster.kusto.windows.net
‚úÖ mycluster.kusto.windows.net (auto-adds https://)
‚ùå Invalid formats will be caught by validation
```

### üîÑ Managing Multiple Clusters
- Add dev, staging, and production clusters
- Use descriptive cluster names for easy identification
- Remove unused clusters to keep the tree clean

### üöÄ Performance Optimization
- Database discovery happens once per cluster add
- Tree refresh updates without re-authenticating
- Minimal network calls for tree operations

### üîê Security Considerations
- Always use HTTPS cluster URLs
- Regularly refresh authentication tokens
- Remove unused cluster connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to add cluster"
- Verify cluster URL is correct and accessible
- Check your Azure credentials and permissions
- Ensure network connectivity to the cluster

#### "Authentication required"
- Complete the device code authentication flow
- Check if authentication tokens have expired
- Try refreshing the connection tree

#### "No databases found"
- Verify you have read permissions on the cluster
- Some clusters may not show system databases
- Contact your cluster administrator for access

### Getting Help
- Check the VS Code Developer Console for detailed error logs
- Use the refresh button to retry failed operations
- Refer to the main KustoX documentation for additional support

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- üîÑ **Background Refresh**: Automatic periodic refresh of database lists
- üìä **Database Metadata**: Show table counts and size information
- üè∑Ô∏è **Connection Labels**: Custom names for cluster connections
- üîç **Search and Filter**: Find specific clusters or databases quickly
- üìÅ **Connection Groups**: Organize connections by environment or project
